# Facebook Automation Bot

This is a Python bot developed using PyAutoGUI and Selenium for automating Facebook actions, including opening profiles, logging into accounts, and listing items in the marketplace.

## How to Use

1. **Pin the Browser Tabs:**
   - Pin the browser's page at the 1st index, beside the Windows start button.
   - In the first tab: Account's List.
   - In the second tab: Listing Items.

2. **Run the Bot:**
   - Click on `facebookAutomationBotV1.6.exe` to start the bot.

3. **Select the Product:**
   - Go to the item list and click on the image's drive link of the product you want to add.

4. **Switch Tabs and Select Account:**
   - After selecting the product image, change the tab and click on the profile name of the account where you want to list the product.

5. **Stop and Restart:**
   - Always make sure to stop the bot first if it is already running in the background. Restarting without stopping may cause errors and overlapping. Stop the bot before starting it again.

6. **Handle Notifications:**
   - If a notification alert box shows up, you can use the mouse to close this box. It is recommended to avoid any other actions while the bot is running.

7. **Stop the Bot After Listing:**
   - After listing, stop the bot, and then restart it if needed by clicking the start button.

## Precautions

- **Bot Setup:**
  - Extract the `facebookbot.zip` file to the C drive. The URL for each image should look like: `C:\facebookBot\clickImages\image.png`.

- **City Names:**
  - Ensure all city names are searchable to change the location in the marketplace.

- **Image Sharing:**
  - Images in the drive should be shared with everyone.

- **Image Size:**
  - List item image size should be less than 5MB. Check Facebook's listing item policies for maximum text length.

## Notes for Better Performance

- **Restart PC:**
  - Restart your PC after listing more than 30 items or after 2.5 to 3.5 hours of usage.

- **Restart the Bot:**
  - Close and run the bot again by clicking on `facebookAutomationBotV1.6.exe` or from the taskbar if itâ€™s already pinned.
